\section{Introduction} %% First Section
This dashboard loads data from server via XHR requests and (depending on server speed) is able to visualize data in under 1 second. This documentation describes how to modify the data to fit your needs and how to change the skinning to meet your styleguide.

\subsection{Dashboard's Main Page}

The main page is divided in two parts. First we have the graphic, it is sorted by ticket type. Next, in the right part (If we are on desktop), or, in the bottom part (If we are on mobile), there are 4 tables with monthly information for each data type. It shows totals and percentages\par

\end{center}
Data can be ordered by:
\begin{itemize} %% Unordered List with dots
	\item By Priority [1,2,3,4] Being 1 the most critical and 4 the less critical
	\item By Ticket Type
	\item By Application/Service
	\item By Status
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note:} All of these can be changed, for example. Instead of Ticket Type, Sales Channel, instead of By priority, by Clothes Size, etc. Everything can be modified according to your needs.\par

If the color in .progress is the same as the background color of the dashboard, the bar will not have a visible background\par

\newpage
\section{Introducing Data} %% Section three \_ \_ of filename.csv needed to print _
The data insertion or edition is done by editing the file Mobile\_List\_Chart.csv (Located in .src/assets/reports/), it is mandatory to use the same name in the ticket type column  inside the csv and in the colorscheme inside config.json (Located in .src/assets/). If not, when clicking in the bar chart, data will not be displayed correctly.\par

\subsection{dashboardhelper.sh}
Every time Mobile\_List\_Chart.csv is modified, it is important to execute dashboardhelper.sh (Located in .scripts/), this script will read the csv and will complete the other CSV files such as Mobile\_Tickets\_Priority.csv or Mobile\_Tickets\_Service.csv, among others. it is very simple to run the script, just open a terminal in ./scripts folder and run ./dashboardhelper.sh -m. For futher information, run ./dashboardhelper -h or ./dashboardhelper --help\par

\subsection{Table Column Names}
In order to change column names to your needs, edit ``cell\_header'' in the language files inside src/assets/i18n.\par

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Configure XHR}
In order to configure XHR, ``fullUrl'' and ``portalFolder'' must be edited inside config.json. In \textbf{fullUrl} you have to specify the protocol and domain, for example:\\\textbf{``https://www.yourdomain.com''}. In \textbf{portalFolder} you have to specify the route to the main page, for example: \textbf{``/your/route''}, this URL's will be concatenated so the final url wil be \textbf{``https://www.yourdomain.com/your/route''}.\par
\bigskip

\textbf{Note:} portalFolder can be empty if main page is located in \textbf{``/''}.\par
\smallskip

\textbf{Note:} It is important to be careful with ``/'' in fullUrl and portalFolder, for example, if fullUrl is \textbf{``https://www.yourdomain.com/''} and portalFolder is \textbf{``/your/route''} your final URL will be \textbf{``https://www.yourdomain.com//your/route''}. So you can specify it at the end of fullUrl or at the start of portalFolder, but not in both of them.	\par
